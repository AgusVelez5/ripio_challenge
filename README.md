# Ripio Challenge

This is a tiny api that uses express to interact to with [__ProductFactory__](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xd9E0b2C0724F3a01AaECe3C44F8023371f845196#code) contract on Polygon Mumbai Blockchain.

Clone the repo, fill the [__env variables__](./.env.sample) and then run:

```sh
  ./init.sh
```

Run locally:

```sh
  npm start
```

Or use docker:

```sh
  docker-compose up
```

Running on port 3000.
